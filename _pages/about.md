<font color="red">One paper accepted by ICCV 2017(Oral)</font>

<font color="red">One paper accept(with  mandatory minor revisions) by TIP 2017</font>

<font color="red">I'm looking for a postdoctoral positions in Computer Vision and Deep learning in 2018 fall.</font>
<br/>
I'm a PhD student at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, supervised by [**Prof. Yu Qiao**](https://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao/), Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
I'm very luck to have close cooperation with [**Dr. Yali Wang**].

Research
======
My research mainly focused on **Recurrent Network**, especially LSTM, and its applications on video based **action recognition**.
<!--I expect to do some end-to-end research in these areas.-->
Iâ€˜m also interested in reinforcement learning and machine learning 
<!--and information visualization.-->
