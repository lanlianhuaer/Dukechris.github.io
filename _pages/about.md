<font color="red">One paper accepted by ICCV 2017, it's my first publication ~ cheers!</font>

<br/>

<font color="red">I'm looking for a Ph.D position in Computer Vision and Deep learning in 2018 fall.</font>

<br/>

I got my Bsc. Engineering on Software Engineering in Tianjin University at 2017 fall. I'm also minored in financial management. I am an IEEE Member.
Now I am an intern computer vision researcher, supervised by [**Dr. Junjie Yan**](www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/jjyan/main.htm) at [SenseTime](www.sensetime.com) and do research about face recognition and deep learning.
I am also a visiting student at Multimedia Lab, supervised by [**Prof. Yu Qiao**](mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao/), Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
I'm very luck to have close cooperation with [**Zhiyuan Fang**](jacobswan1.github.io). 
I love playing the piano and photograph. I'll be very happy if we can talk about these.

Research
======
I am interested in **deep learning** and its applications on **computer vision** for face recognition. I expect to do some end-to-end research in these areas.
I also interested in reinforcement learning, machine learning and information visualization.
